# Chess-by-Leo_craft1
This is a chess game made in Java by me. It runs on command line.

To download it go under the RELEASES tab, then download the latest version: the file is called Scacchi.jar (you can rename it whatever you want). Also might be useful to download the Launcher.bat or Launcher.sh depending on your operating system.

To execute it just place the jarfile and the Launcher.bat or .sh in the same directory and double click on the Launcher script.
